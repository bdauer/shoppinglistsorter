I do the shopping in my household. My wife writes up what she needs
but her lists aren't sorted.

This script takes a shopping list in csv format, sorts it
by store and item type, and prints to the default output.
The csv file should be provided as argv[1].

CSV format example:
bananas,produce,russos
3 apples,produce,russos
2 oranges,produce,stopnshop
LED lightbulbs,utility,stopnshop
